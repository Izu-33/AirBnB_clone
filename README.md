# AirBnB_clone

 The goal of the Air_BnB clone project is to deploy on a server a simple copy
 of the [AirBnB website](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m8g02HcD2ovrl_K-zulYBw).
 By the end of this project timeline, the complete web application will be composed of:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a Shell
- A website (front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data=objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them, i.e., CRUD)

## Final product
